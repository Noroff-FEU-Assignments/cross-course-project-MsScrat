        <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?</p>
        <p id="web-security-answer">To ensure that the data accepted is in the right format, data sanitization could be done manually or by using a third-pary solution. Make sure that the third-party application is trusted and tested beforehand. Further, one can secure all authorization and authentication by using an open-standard authorization protocol or framework such as OneLogin, in addition to implement an automatic user timeout so that no sensitive information is hanging in the browser. Lastly, one could use CI/CD in development, which is an automatic process of integrating and delivering code to production, so that any change that does not pass the checks would be rejected and flagged for rework.</p>
