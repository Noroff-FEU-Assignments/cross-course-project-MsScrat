        <h2>Web Security</h2>
        <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?</p>
        <p id="web-security-answer">To ensure that data entries is in the right format, data sanitization could be done manually or by using a trusted third-pary solution. Further, one can secure all authorization and authentication by using an open-standard authorization protocol or framework, such as OneLogin, to enable two-factor authentication (or more). In addition to this, one can also implement an automatic user timeout so that the session expires, making sure no sensitive information is hanging in the browser. For development, one could use CI/CD, which is an automatic process of integrating and delivering code to production, so that any change that does not pass the checks would be rejected and flagged for rework. When that said, I would in general recommend the client to be aware of the most common web security threats. To check the security of a website, one can use websites like https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/website-scanner to scan a page for potential threats or https://owasp.org to see the top ten most critical security concerns.</p>
